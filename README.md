During my role as a Data Research Assistant at the Environmental Finance Center at the University of North Carolina (UNC), I independently developed a water rate affordability analysis dashboard using R Shiny. As the primary developer, I designed the complete UI, including navigation bars, home page display, dashboards, data tables, and visualizations. Due to confidentiality, specific code cannot be disclosed.

The dashboard utilizes R Shinyâ€™s ui and server architecture, integrating data visualization libraries like leaflet for mapping and ggplot2 for analytics. Its core features include a municipal unit selector, geographic distribution maps, and interactive data analysis charts. I also optimized the user interface by applying custom CSS, ensuring a smooth user experience and intuitive design.

This tool empowers decision-makers by providing an interactive platform to better understand and formulate water pricing policies.
