Although different groups have their own unique interpretation of the resulting value, the calculation is relatively standard.

Digging deeper into this variable, however, reveals that it is not as simple as most people consider it to be.

On the other hand, the same threshold is cited as sometimes pressuring a water utility to keep rates too low, while many of the utility's customers can easily handle a higher rate.
